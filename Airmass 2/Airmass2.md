# What I do in this folder.<br>
We wanted to check how the change in obersving conditions affects our results. In this folder, I investigate the model's sestivity on airmass values of 1 and 2 respectively.<br>
In this folder I train a model based on simulations with everything else kept same but airmass changed from 1 to 2.<br>
In "Using binary model airmass 1" I train a model using simulation with airmass 1 and check on the data from airmass 2 and 1 respectively.<br>
In "Using binary model airmass 2" I train a model using simulation with airmass 2 and check on the data from airmass 1 and 2 respectively.<br>
