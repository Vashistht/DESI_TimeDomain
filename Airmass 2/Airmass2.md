# What I do in this folder.<br>

We wanted to check how the changes in obersving conditions affect the performance of our classifier. In this folder, I investigate the model's sestivity on airmass values of 1 and 2 respectively.<br>
- In <B>"Using binary model airmass 1"</B> I train a model using simulation with airmass 1 and check on the data from airmass 2 and 1 respectively.<br>
- In  <B>"Using binary model airmass 2"</B> I train a model using simulation with airmass 2 and check on the data from airmass 1 and 2 respectively.<br>
