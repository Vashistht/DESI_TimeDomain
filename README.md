- Working under Professor Segev Benzvi on Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument. Currently, we are in the process of training a neural network to recognise host and SN, in order to automate the study of millions of spectra.<br />
- This is a place to dump files I made for this research project, to see the work in progress and to create an online copy to prevent losing these files.<br />
